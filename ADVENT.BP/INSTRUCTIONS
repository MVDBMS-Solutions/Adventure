Introduction to ADVENTURE

"Adventure" was the first program in a category of software that
became known as "interactive fiction". It was initially developed in
the mid-70's by Willie Crowther at MIT; many of the game's current
features were added by Don Woods at the Stanford Artificial
Intelligence Laboratory. Although "Adventure" is arguably one of the
most influential, popular, and widespread computer game in computing 
history, its authors never received any royalties or fees from their
creation.

This version of "Adventure" is a relatively faithful copy of the
FORTRAN original. It was revised and adapted for CDI in 1985 by 
David Ruggiero, working from an uncredited translation of the 
program into BASIC that had been floating around the Pick world
for several years. Permission is granted to redistribute it as 
long as these attributions, and those in the source code, remain intact.

Good luck, enjoy the game, and remember: *never* feed the dwarves!
